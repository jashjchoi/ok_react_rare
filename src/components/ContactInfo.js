                    <p>Connect with us on social media. Learn more about Oklahoma Rare, our founders, and events we are attending. I don't like the way this looks right now, I need to add more here. But this is the test to make sure it is still rendering when the footer is added. So lots of text lots of text lots of text. </p>
