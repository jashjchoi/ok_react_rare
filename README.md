<h3 align="center">Oklahoma Rare</h3>

  <p align="center">
    Oklahoma Rare is a non-profit advocacy group started by two parents of children with rare diseases. The goal of the organization is to promote community within the rare community and their families. This project is the final project during our time at Holberton, and we chose to create a React app to help people in the rare community manage day-to-day tasks. The application also includes information about the Oklahoma Rare organization, and allows for users to login and view their private tasks.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.
### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
```sh
npm install
```

### Installation

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

In the project directory, you can run:

```
npm start
```
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

```
npm test
```
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

```
npm run build
```
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!
See the section about deployment for more information.

```
npm run eject
```
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!
If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.


The entry point for the application is the landing page. Here users can login or register using their Google account.
Once a user is logged in, they can access the Dashboard. While on the Dashboard, users can create, edit, delete, and manage tasks in their calendar. Users can also create helpful tags to help track their events.
If the user does not log into the application, they can view the About and Contact pages.

_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://example.com)_
