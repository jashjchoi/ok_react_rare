<h3 align="center">Oklahoma Rare</h3>

  <p align="center">
    Oklahoma Rare is a non-profit advocacy group started by two parents of children with rare diseases. The goal of the organization is to promote community within the rare community and their families. This project is the final project during our time at Holberton, and we chose to create a React app to help people in the rare community manage day-to-day tasks. The application also includes information about the Oklahoma Rare organization, and allows for users to login and view their private tasks.
